The notice shall list the reported violations that are the basis of the points charged, list the number of points charged for each violation, and state that because the total number of points charged against the person within the applicable two-year period is equal to 12 or more, the registrar is imposing a class D suspension of the person's driver's or commercial driver's license/permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period of time specified in §4510.02(B)(4). The notice also shall state that the suspension is effective on the 12th day after the mailing of the notice, unless the person files a petition appealing the determination and suspension in the municipal court, county court, or, if the person is under the age of 18, the juvenile division of the Court of Common Pleas in whose jurisdiction the person resides or, if the person is not a resident of this state, in the Franklin County Municipal Court or juvenile division of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.

If the record indicates that 12 points or more have been charged against the person within a two-year period, it is prima-facie evidence that the person is a repeat traffic offender, and the registrar shall suspend the person's driver's or commercial driver's license/permit or nonresident operating privilege pursuant to division (B).
 
In hearing the petition and determining whether the person filing the petition has shown cause why the person's driver's or commercial driver's license/permit or nonresident operating privilege should not be suspended, the court shall decide the issue on the record certified by the Registrar and any additional relevant, competent, and material evidence that either the registrar or the person whose license is sought to be suspended submits.

(f) such person submits proof of financial responsibility; and
(g) refusal to issue a probationary driver's license would cause extreme hardship to the applicant. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “extreme hardship” means that the applicant cannot reasonably obtain other transportation, and, therefore, the applicant would be prohibited from:

Any court in which such conviction is had or in which said nolo contendere plea is accepted shall require the licensee to surrender the license to the court. The court shall forward the license to the department within 10 days after the conviction or acceptance of the plea, with a copy of the conviction. Any person whose probationary license is revoked for committing an offense listed in §40-5-54 or §40-6-391 shall not be eligible to apply for a regular driver's license until the expiration of the original five-year revocation period during which the probationary license was originally issued or for a period of two years following the conviction, whichever is greater.
 
(e)(6)(C) If the commissioner has reason to believe or makes a preliminary finding that the requirements of the public safety or welfare outweigh the individual needs of a person for a probationary license, the commissioner, in his or her discretion, after affording the person notice and an opportunity to be heard, may refuse to issue the license.
 
(e)(6)(D) Any person whose probationary driver's license has been revoked shall not be eligible to apply for a subsequent probationary license for a period of five-years.
 
(e)(7) Any person whose probationary license has been revoked or who has been refused a probationary license by the department may make a request in writing for a hearing to be provided by the department. Such hearing shall be provided within 30 days after the receipt of a request and shall follow the procedures required by the “Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.” Appeal from such hearing shall be in accordance with the “Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.”
 
(f) If a person's license was revoked for a violation resulting from a motor vehicle collision in which any person lost his life, the person whose license was revoked shall not be entitled to a probationary license."

(a) three of more convictions, singularly or in combination, of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs;
(b) operating a motor vehicle recklessly or negligently so that the lives and safety of the public might be endangered;
(c) making a false statement in an application for a learner’s permit or motor vehicle operator’s license or in an application for registration of a motor vehicle;

When the records of the registrar on any person contain reports of convictions included above, the registrar shall hold a hearing within six months from the third conviction, and shall give notice to such person that a hearing will be held to show cause why such person should not be designated as an habitual traffic offender. Notice shall be sent no less than 21 days prior to the date for the hearing, shall contain a list of the person's convictions, and shall otherwise be in such form as the registrar shall prescribe. If the person named in the notice is a nonresident, notice shall be sent to his or her last known address of which the registrar has a record; or, if none, to the motor vehicle department of any state in which such person resides or which has issued a motor vehicle operator's license or permit to such person. If such person denies he or she was convicted of any offenses necessary for a determination that he or she is a habitual offender, and if the registrar cannot, on the evidence available to it, make such determination, the registrar may refer the decision of the issue to the court in which the conviction was made. Said court shall then conduct a hearing to determine the issue and send a certified copy of its final order determining the issue to the registrar.
 
If the registrar finds that such person is not the same person named in the records of conviction, or that he or she is otherwise not a habitual offender, no action shall be taken. But if the registrar finds that such person is the same person named in the record of conviction and that such person is a habitual offender, the registrar shall immediately revoke such person's license or right to operate.The registrar, after having revoked the license or right to operate of any person, shall not issue a new license or reinstate the right to operate to such person for a period of four-years from the date of revocation, nor until such person has satisfactorily completed a driver improvement course approved by the registrar and has passed such examination as to his competence to operate motor vehicles as the registrar may require. Provided, however, that such person may, after the expiration of one-year, apply for and shall be granted a hearing before the registrar for the purpose of requesting the issuance of a new license on a limited basis on the sole grounds of hardship, and the registrar may, in its discretion, issue such a license under such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate and necessary. An appeal to the Superior Court may be had from any order of the registrar of motor vehicles made regarding the designation of a habitual offender."
